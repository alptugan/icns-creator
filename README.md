## DEMO & Instructions & QuickStart

The UI is a lot different with the v1. The following video is still appropriate. icns Creator is a macOS application that allows you to easily create icns files from any PNG or JPG image file. With this tool, you can quickly generate high-quality icns files to use as icons for your macOS applications or generate a single appropriate .iconset file. Codesigning is an headache for me! And I do not want to pay for an app that I release as open-source. You can review the code, if you have concerns about the app. Or simply, you can choose not to use the app üññüèª.

2. Move the unzipped `icns Creator.app` file to your Applications folder. **DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK.**

</p>

Choose `Anywhere` option under `System Settings`->`Privacy & Security`->`Security` section.

### Option 2 (Without disabling the Gate Keeper)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/alptugan/icns-creator/releases) page. 
2. Since the app is not signed by Apple, your OS does not open the app.You must enable 

`System Settings`->`Privacy & Security`->`Security`->`App Store and identified developers` option. 

3. Unzip the file. Double-click on icns Creator application file (`icns-creator.app`) to run it. It will not open because it is from an unidentified developer. Goto `System Settings`->`Privacy & Security`->`Security` and click `Open Anyway` button.
4. If prompted, allow the application to run on your system.
5. You're ready to start creating icns files out of PNG, JPG, or any other image document!

### Option 3 (For developers)
To build the app by yourself or make modifications on the source code (Optional). If you have issues because of Apple's security issues, or you do not prefer to install compiled apps, you can compile the app by yourself and review the code as well.

1. Install XCode application from Appstore.
2. Download or clone the repository.
<p style="margin-bottom:20px" align="center">
    <img src="./assets/icns_dev_tut1.jpeg" width="80%">
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:20px" align="center">

4. Hit `Run` button to compile the project.
<p style="margin-bottom:20px" align="center">
    <img src="./assets/icns_dev_tut3.jpeg" width="80%">
</p>

## Usage for Designers & Developers

1. Prepare your image file in your preferred image editor, ensuring it has a minimum size of 1024x1024 pixels.
2. Save the image file as a PNG or JPG file in a 1:1 aspect ratio for the best results.
3. Open the icns Creator application.
4. Click the `Browse` button or drag & drop the image.
5. `.iconset` tab creates a single icon file, or `.icns` tab creates individual .icns files required for html pages.
6. By default shadow, rounded corners and padding for the generated icon is enabled. For recent Mac OS standards, you should enable all of the options to apply Apple Design standarts. If you just want to generate .icns files as before, disable all of the options.
7. The files will be created in the same directory as the original image file.
